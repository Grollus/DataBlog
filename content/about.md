Hi! I'm a Data Scientist attempting to quantify and understand our messy world.  I am primarily interested in data visualization, data analysis, 
machine learning, education and city development/planning. Most of this blog will probably be dedicated to those topics.  However, 
I'm curious to a fault, so topics may meander to other areas. 

In my free time you can find me running. Or hiking. Or maybe just reading outside.  If I'm not there, I'm probably roasting coffee. Delicious coffee.
